1. My program Compiles with "javac *java‚Äù.




2. The Main method is in Oblig2.java file.




3. Assumptions




4. Peculiarities

	I did not find any.

5. Status

	Every thing is working properly as i know:

	a. The file is read,
	b. The tasks were created and assigned its values that are read from the file.

	c. Event edges were created.

	d. Checks the graph cyclic if any and prints the nodes that are part of the cycle.

	e. Printing outputs as the assignment suggests.

	f. suggests/ prints the usage of the program if the right parameters were not passed.






6. Credit


	My code is influenced by "Data structures and
	algorithm analysis in Java by MARK ALLEN WEISS. Third Edition." 
        from page 381, notably when it comes to converting the Activity node 
	into event node. and when calculating the Earliest and Latest Completion Time
	and the slack.
