/**

    I implemented this class with the concept of converting the Activity node graph into Event node graph,
    in Data Structures and Algorith Analysis in java by Mark Allen Weiss page 381.
    Event nodes are double as Activity node plus two. Each Activity node is represented two event node i.e Real and Dummy events
    Real events are weighted task time (that is read from the input file) Dummy events are weighted by Zero.
