Project: Home Exam INF1060


The program HomeExam.c takes a line as user input.
Reads the line and then splitts as word; word means here sequece of letters without space.
and then puts into an array. Later on the command will be executed. 
The program will also stores the commands into link list and prints the last history commands if the user presses h.
The program will also exits if the user presses Enter key with out putting commands.

When the program excutes a command will start a child process and that needs to include a safefork.c that we got it to use.

I will also use some Header files that is necessary for the program to run.




The ingredients are:

HomeExam.c	A c program that takes a user input and excutes some shell built-in commands. 	

Safefork.c   	A c program that we got as readymade and starts a child process.

I have also tried the bitmap staff but i did find it working perfect

I will use a make file (type make).
